# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

  ## Description of design choices
  I decided to choose to navigate through the maze because in my personal opinion, I lack the creativity to make my finch dance or draw something. If I were to navigate through the maze, I thought that it would just need a simple algorithim.

  ## Challenges faced and solutions
  Throughout the project, I faced many problems. Some were uncontrollable on the track, and others were just a limiting factor of the finch robot. In light of these challenges that made it so that my attempted algorithim would have trouble working unless the conditions were perfect, my solution was to just hard code portions of the maze.

  ## Future enhancements
If I were to have more time on this finch project, I would probable add more conditional statements to improve the algorithim that I tried to create,
